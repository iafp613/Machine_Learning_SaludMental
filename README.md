_In these confused times where epidemics, snowfalls, earthquakes and volcanoes have us with our souls in suspense; mental health takes on more important value than ever._

_I'm from Asturias, Spain, and it is the region of my country with the highest suicide rate._

_Every time I watch the news, I see gender violence, gang rapes, bullying, suicides, parricides, infanticides, pederasty... Are we really going crazy?_

_With this study, I have proposed a series of models that can predict whether or not a patient should be treated psychologically based on previous data such as age, gender, family history, employment, etc._

_The objective of this is not to propose a real solution as a productive model, but rather to serve in a didactic way._

_Thanks in advance for getting here, I hope you like it and if so or if you have any suggestions, follow me on social media! It is appreciated._

## Starting 🚀

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development, testing, or viewing purposes._

Inside the `src` folder is the main notebook `main`, which contains all the information on the cleaning, visualization and data analysis processes, as well as the implemented machine learning models.

If we go to the `data` folder, we can access all the *.csv* files that have been used or generated in this project. The `survey.csv` file is the original data, `results.csv` is the returned results, and `submission.csv` is the prediction results.


### Requirements 📋

_In order to run the entire code, you will need to have a number of libraries installed (as well as Python v.3.7.4). All the libraries that have been used are:_

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
scipy.stats
sklearn
tensorflow
mlxtend
```


### Installation 🔧

**Remember:**

*In the terminal of your operating system:*

```
pip3 install pandas
```

```
pip3 install numpy
```
*Etc.*
